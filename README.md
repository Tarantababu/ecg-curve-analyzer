# ECG Curve Analyzer

## Overview
The ECG Curve Analyzer is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to analyze ECG images. Users can upload an ECG image, select a region of interest, and visualize both the normal and inverted ECG curves. The app also calculates the area under each curve.

## Features
- Upload ECG images in JPEG or PNG format.
- Draw a bounding box to select the region of interest.
- Display the cropped ECG region.
- Plot both the normal and inverted ECG curves.
- Calculate and display the area under both curves.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating web applications easily.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plotting.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **SciPy**: For integration calculations.
- **scikit-image**: For image analysis.
